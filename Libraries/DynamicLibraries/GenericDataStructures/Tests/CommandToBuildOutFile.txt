1) First create an object (.o) file:
"gcc -ansi -pedantic -g3 {-Wall -Wextra -Werror} -c <c_source_file>.c"

2) Create an executable (.out) file with the created dynamic lib:
"gcc -o <exec_file_name>.out <obj_file_name>.o -L../../../GenericDataStructures -lGenericDataStructures"
(-L -> The path to the dynamic library, then -l... == the lib name (without the "lib" starting string))

3) To make the PATH know where to look for the dynamic lib (Have to repeat this every time after closing the Shell):
-> 2 commands:
"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:." (the . is the current dir, if the lib is at other path - put the path instead of the dot)
"export LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

(
In our case [from each test directory]:
"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:../../../GenericDataStructures/"
)
